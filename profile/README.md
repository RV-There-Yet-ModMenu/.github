## ❓ FAQ

### 🧭 1. Is the Mod Menu safe?

Yes — it’s memory-based only and doesn’t alter original game files. Configs and patches are fully reversible.

### ⚡ 2. Does it work online?

The tool is intended for **offline use**. Multiplayer or shared-world sessions may reject modified values.

### 🔁 3. How do updates work?

The injector auto-detects version mismatches and adjusts memory offsets. Manual updates are rarely needed.

### 🎨 4. Can I design my own overlay theme?

Yes. Simply edit `UI_Theme.json` to customize fonts, color palettes, and layout spacing.

### 🗺 5. Where are my travel presets saved?

They’re stored under `Documents\RVThereYet\Presets\`, where you can import or export routes.
